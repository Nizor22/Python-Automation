# Online Attendance Automation

COVID19 had brought a new problem of online attendance completion,
and since I had more than just one and had to do it every weekday, 
I created this script to automate my attendance. 

The script logs on to the gmail, parses messages containing attendance,
opens their links in a browser with new tabs for every url, and does the attendance for you.


# Usage:
    1) Open the credentials.txt and change the credentials to your own.
    2) Using location_finder modify the script to fit for your own classes.
    3) Run the script, and make sure you are in the right working directory.
